# Exploring Gentrification Using Airbnb Data

This repository is a living log of my senior thesis research. It is very much a work in progress; please excuse the mess. 

## Research Question

Throughout this process, my guiding research question will be: *can neighborhood residents see gentrification in action and can this awareness be translated into a useful quantitative tool for researchers.*


## Motivation & Background

Gentrification is a hot topic in literature and the public discourse. It is also something I'm woefully unknowledgeable about. I'm undertaking this research project in order to deepen my understanding and potentially contribute to the quantitative understanding of the subject.

Gentrification is generally understood as a process of change whereby neighborhoods which have been historically under-capitalized experience an influx of new residents with high social capital. This demographic change corresponds with an increase in investment in the neighborhood, generally transforming the housing stock and character of the neighborhood, while also displacing the original lower income residents of the neighborhood. Each of the three pillars of change (demographic, housing and retail stock, and cultural character) have characteristics which make quantifying their change difficult, and which consequently limits scholarship and effective policy intervention. 

One of the principle data challenges is that detailed demographic data is infrequently collected, so researchers and policymakers are constantly fettered by data from the Census or the 5 year American Community Survey. This lag means that research must be conducted on sparse time series, limiting the research's power, while on the policy side the lag makes early identification of gentrification difficult, and dynamic monitoring impossible. Changes in the physical neighborhood real-estate composition are generally the easiest to detect, as home prices, building permits, and other measures of investment operate on shorter lag. The final pillar of change is also the most difficult to quantify. While the arrival of craft coffee shops, whole foods, and street art may be easily visible signs of cultural change for residents of a gentrifying neighborhood, this local knowledge does not get translated into traditional data sets. However, new data sources may solve some of these challenges.

Today, more complicated and less structured data are becoming available to researchers with a lag of weeks or months, rather than years. While some of these data are also found in traditional datasets, there also exist new, less structured features which can be used to better understand neighborhoods and their residents. In this project I plan to use listing data on Airbnbs in major US cities to determine neighborhood features associated with gentrification. While these data may be able to pick up demographic changes in neighborhoods, I believe they will provide the most use in quantifying cultural change. This quantification will be a function of both structured features, such as the density of listings and their prices, and unstructured features, namely the text descriptions of Airbnb listings and their neighborhoods. *If the markers of cultural change are indeed visible to residents, the text description of a given Airbnb and its neighborhood should reflect that change.*
